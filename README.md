Deep dive into global and domestic energy markets.

## Why Energy?

My interest in energy started from the realization that energy has become a fundamental part of life and opportunity in the developed world. With the increasing need for the internet and the opportunities new technologies bring, the lack of access to electricity that much of the world faces creates an ever increasing level of inequality between the haves and have nots. 

This led to three main sets of questions: 
1) Who and where are the people who lack access to electricity? Are there fundamental reasons that make it difficult to provide them access?
2) What systems (infrastructure, generation, etc) do developed countries use? What could the next generation of the grid and energy production systems look like?
3) Is there a new system that could replace outdated energy systems in developed countries that could scale and be implemented in areas without access?


## What is RfSolar?

RfSolar is Rethinking Energy Infrastructure.

The current system relies on centralized energy generation and capital intensive tranmission and distribution infrastructure.

RfSolar hopes to shift toward a more decentralized and distributed system of energy generation and storage through a mix of smart grid and microgrid technologies. 

The Dream is to shift away from large energy suppliers that dominate the markets and instead create a free flowing environment where energy is exchanged in an ecosystem where individuals can buy and sell energy within their communities. For this to be a viable option there has to be a change in how we view energy altogether. Yes. There are issues with our current infrastructure in the US and there are hundreds of millions in the world who donâ€™t even have access to energy but instead of waiting for large corporations or politicians to make changes for us we need to realize that we have the power to make changes in our own behavior that will have real impacts on the future of energy in our communities and around the world.

# Energy Data Project - Outline

To challenge all of the assumptions made when thinking about the problem and coming up with possible solutions there was a need to explore and understand energy markets at the global (macro) level as well as take a deeper dive into individual countries and even state energy infrastructures.

### Global Energy Market Analysis

The first step to understanding energy started with a macro global look into the energy markets. This notebook explores WorldBank data to help understand the level of access of energy around the world as well as energy production and the types of fuels used around the world.

### US Solar Market Analysis

The US Market Analysis heavily revolves around solar in terms of net production potential around the US as well as getting a deeper understanding of the demographic of solar producers today.

### California Energy Market Analysis

The California Energy Analysis takes a look into CAISO data to get an understanding of grid management and the dynamic nature of supply and demand at the state level. Being from California was also interested in seeing the distribution of fuels and patterns in energy demand.

### Microgrid Analysis
